This project develops a **Cyber Activity Risk Analyzer** that classifies login activity scores into Low, Medium, High, and Critical risk categories.
The program accepts multiple scores as input, ignores negative values, and counts both valid and invalid entries.
The register number used is **AP24110011665**, and the last digit (D = 5) determines the personalization rule.
Since D is odd, all **Critical Risk** scores are removed after categorization as part of the personalized security filter.
Finally, the program displays the filtered risk lists along with total valid entries, ignored entries, and the number of records removed due to personalization.
